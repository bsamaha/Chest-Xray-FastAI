# Summary:
This classifier was created using the Fastai library which is built upon Pytorch. In this project I have built a model from the Chest X-Ray dataset curated by Kaggle to predict if a patient has pneumonia using chest x-ray images. There was a total of about ~5000 images with a total size of just over 1 GB. This model used transfer learning and started with the ResNet34 architecture and was fine tuned for this case. Transfer learning allowed for faster training time, and cultivated a more accurate model that needed less data than from scratch. The final result was an image classification project that was able to detect pneumonia with ~92% accuracy overall.

This repo was made to coincide with the blog post 
[Deep Learning Image Classification withÂ Fast.ai](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-image-classification-with-fast-ai-fc4dc9052106). 

The data set is from the [Kaggle Chest X-Ray Images
